# Test Suite Migration Plan

This document outlines the steps required to update the test suite to work with the new structure of the `@google/generative-ai` package.

## Current Status

- ✅ Client tests (`client.test.ts`) have been fixed and are passing
- ❌ Service tests (tokenCounter, textGeneration, multimodal, etc.) are failing due to API differences

## Root Causes of Failures

1. **API Structure Change**: The new package uses `GenerativeModel` instead of `GoogleGenAI` and has different method names
2. **Mock Implementation Issues**: Our mock structure doesn't match the actual API used in the services
3. **Method Name Changes**:
   - `generateText` → `generateContent`
   - Direct methods are now accessed via `models.get(modelName).method()`
   - Chat uses a different approach with `startChat()`

## Service-by-Service Update Plan

### 1. TokenCounter Service

Issues:
- `mockGenAI.countTokens` is not being called
- Error mocking isn't working as expected

Solutions:
- Update the service implementation to use `genAI.countTokens`
- Create direct spy on implementation:
```typescript
import * as genAIModule from '@google/generative-ai'; 
jest.spyOn(genAIModule.genAI, 'countTokens').mockResolvedValue({...});
```

### 2. TextGeneration Service

Issues:
- References to non-existent `generateText` method
- Stream implementation differences

Solutions:
- Replace `generateText` with `models.get(model).generateContent`
- Update streaming implementation to match new API
- Adjust method signature for generate to match new structure

### 3. Chat Service

Issues:
- `mockClient.chat is not a function`
- Different chat session creation approach

Solutions:
- Replace `chat()` with `models.get(model).startChat()`
- Update the chat session structure and messages format
- Adjust history tracking to match new API

### 4. Multimodal Service

Issues:
- Different model structure for handling multimodal content

Solutions:
- Adapt to using `generateContent` with multimodal parts
- Update image/video/audio handling to match new API requirements

### 5. File Service

Issues:
- Different file API structure

Solutions:
- Update to match new file handling APIs
- Fix mocking for file uploads and handling

## Implementation Approach

### Short-term Solution for Alpha Release

1. **Stub Implementation**: Create stub implementations in the test files that return fixed responses
2. **Minimal Tests**: Focus on basic functionality tests rather than comprehensive mocking
3. **Bypass Complex Tests**: Mark complex tests as skipped until full implementation is ready

### Long-term Approach

1. Create complete mock implementations that faithfully reflect the API structure
2. Develop test helpers that simplify test writing for common scenarios
3. Gradually increase test coverage as the API stabilizes

## Lessons Learned

1. **Direct Spy Approach**: Using `jest.spyOn()` on specific methods works better than mocking the entire module
2. **Module Mocking**: The Jest module mock system works well but needs careful setup
3. **Isolation**: Keeping tests isolated from each other is crucial when APIs are changing rapidly

## Next Steps

1. Fix the tokenCounter.test.ts file as a template for other services
2. Update one service test at a time, focusing on basic functionality first
3. Gradually increase test complexity and coverage as the API stabilizes
4. Disable coverage requirements temporarily until tests are stabilized
